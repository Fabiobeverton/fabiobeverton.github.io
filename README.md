# 🧠 AI Compliance Learning Journey — Fábio Everton

> **Strategic AI Engineering Pathway: Focused on Security, Governance & Regulatory Compliance**

This repository serves as my **central hub for AI, Security, and Governance projects**, as well as a **living technical roadmap** — tracking my immersion in 44 strategically selected certifications and courses. The goal is to master applied AI engineering with emphasis on **secure-by-design architectures, compliance alignment, explainability, DevSecOps pipelines, and audit-ready systems**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Journey?

In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the demand for **secure, ethical, and auditable systems** is non-negotiable. This journey targets advanced, production-ready skills across:

* **🔐 Security & DevSecOps for AI** — Evidence-based, Zero Trust principles across LLM and ML pipelines.
* **🧠 LLMOps & Agent Engineering** — LangChain, RAG pipelines, autonomous agent orchestration.
* **🧭 AI Governance & Global Compliance** — ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, GDPR, and aligned risk controls.
* **⚖️ Responsible AI & Trust** — Explainability (XAI), bias mitigation, ethical frameworks, reproducibility.
* **🔒 Post-Quantum Cryptography & Data Resilience** — Future-proofing AI systems with PQC.
* **📊 Observability & Automated AI Workflows** — Secure, observable, and maintainable AI pipelines.
