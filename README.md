# 🧠 AI Compliance Learning Journey — Fábio Everton  

> **Strategic AI Engineering Pathway: Security, Governance & Hands-On Compliance Builds**  

This repository is my **central hub for AI, Security, and Governance experiments**. It works as a **living roadmap** — documenting my immersion across **44 strategically selected domains**, with a focus on **hands-on labs, technical builds, and compliance-ready AI pipelines**.  

The mission: to master **applied AI engineering** by building **secure-by-design architectures, governance mappings, DevSecOps pipelines, and auditable systems**.  

---

## 🎯 Why This Journey?  

In today’s AI landscape, systems must be **secure, ethical, and auditable by default**. This journey is designed to build **practical, production-ready expertise** in:  

* **🔐 Security & DevSecOps for AI** — Zero Trust pipelines, threat modeling, evidence-based controls.  
* **🧠 LLMOps & Agent Engineering** — LangChain, RAG, orchestration, and evaluation of autonomous agents.  
* **🧭 AI Governance & Global Compliance** — ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, GDPR mappings, audit frameworks.  
* **⚖️ Responsible AI & Trust** — Explainability, bias mitigation, reproducibility, and ethical safeguards.  
* **🔒 Post-Quantum Cryptography & Data Resilience** — Securing AI systems against next-gen threats.  
* **📊 Observability & Automated AI Workflows** — From logging to monitoring, traceability by design.

## 🧭 Study Focus & Technical Domains  

This roadmap covers **strategic knowledge domains** where I am building **hands-on labs, compliance mappings, and exploratory R&D**.  

> ⚠️ *This journey is not about collecting certificates. It’s about building and documenting evidence through code, experiments, and technical execution.*
