## 🧩 Current Project: BRACHAT – Secure LegalTech SaaS

> “Audit-ready SaaS infrastructure with built-in AI, DevSecOps, and compliance orchestration.”

I'm building BRACHAT, a LegalTech SaaS platform designed to automate legal workflows with security and compliance by design.

### Architecture Highlights:

- 🔐 Secure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, SonarCloud, Semgrep, Snyk)
- 🧠 AI layer with LangChain, LLMs, RAG, Explainability, and Vector DBs
- 📜 Dynamic compliance controls aligned with SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR
- 🧩 Modular infrastructure with white-label and multi-tenant capabilities
- 🧾 Audit headers and hash-based source traceability on every build
- 🔑 Auth with JWT, Keycloak, RBAC enforcement, and FastAPI

### Modules in progress:

- Compliance Orchestrator
- LLM Inference Core (LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- RAG Router
- Secure API Gateway
- CI/CD Compliance Injector
- Audit Trail Logger (planned Q3/2025)

🔒 100% DevSecOps-native architecture with full source-to-deploy traceability.

### 🧭 Roadmap (Q3/Q4 2025)

- ✅ Internal modularization for white-label clients
- 🔜 Public CI/CD + Compliance modules under MIT license
- 🔜 LLMOps API Layer + SaaS Agent Integrations
- 🔜 Open source boilerplate for audit-ready SaaS projects
