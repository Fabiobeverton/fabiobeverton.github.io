        I‚Äôm currently studying how to architect secure and auditable AI systems from the ground up ‚Äî covering software infrastructure, governance-first design, LLM workflows, DevSecOps, data compliance, full-stack development, and advanced domains such as NeuroAI and Quantum AI. This site reflects my hands-on learning journey, where every explored capability is eventually versioned and documented in public repositories.
